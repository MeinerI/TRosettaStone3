Catalogues
----------

This section contains reference catalogues of different game assets. Primarily it's entity types, but in the future this section may be extended to include audiotracks, sound samples, animations, state numbers, and so on.

Entity Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are some guidelines to entity table:

* Pick-up items will be marked in [blue]#blue#.
* Nullmeshes (service entities with no render and collision) will be marked in [red]#red#.
* Helper entities never placed in map (e.g. additional Lara animations) will be marked in [green]#green#.
* Unused entities (with no code attached to them) will be marked in [purple]#purple#.
* TR1 and TR2-specific sprite entities will be marked as *bold*.
* Menu items will be marked as _italic_.

NOTE: In all games, Lara is always an entity with ID #0.
